WEBVTT

00:38.205 --> 00:39.039
Hmm.

00:42.793 --> 00:43.627
Mmm.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.648
Hey.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.615
Colonel, give us the room, please.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.959
Four years retired yet two salutes?

04:52.042 --> 04:54.336
- Shows respect.
- Have a seat.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.967
Do you know who I am?

05:00.717 --> 05:02.010
No.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.428
Well, if you were to guess.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.891
Judging by your age, appearance,

05:07.975 --> 05:11.019
and how a Marine colonel
just followed your order without a yip,

05:11.854 --> 05:14.106
I'd guess you're some kind
of high-level spook.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.530
Your father and grandfather served?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.240
Yes.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.953
As an elite sniper,
you have 113 confirmed kills

05:28.036 --> 05:30.706
and an additional 81 probable kills.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.124
Are those numbers accurate?

05:32.624 --> 05:33.458
No.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.421
- Are the actual numbers fewer or greater?
- Greater.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.675
As a veteran, how many private contractors
have you worked for?

05:41.758 --> 05:42.593
Eleven.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.721
But you also still work for
the Marine Corps on occasion?

05:47.055 --> 05:48.390
Anytime they call.

05:48.473 --> 05:52.269
And are you presently under
any private or military contract?

05:54.146 --> 05:54.980
No.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.443
You're an extremely rare talent, Levi.

06:00.944 --> 06:01.778
Why not?

06:04.239 --> 06:07.451
In June, some corporate shrink
told me that I was unfit for a mission,

06:07.534 --> 06:09.244
but I'm sure you already know that.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.537
So why are you asking me?

06:13.624 --> 06:15.417
Do you think you're fit for service?

06:15.501 --> 06:16.960
Doesn't matter what I think.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.049
So, do you presently have a girlfriend?

06:22.132 --> 06:23.300
Anyone special?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.011
Someone who couldn't live without you?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.349
- No.
- Why not?

06:31.517 --> 06:33.060
Just not how it goes for me.

06:35.187 --> 06:39.316
How about meds, illegal drugs, alcohol?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.651
No drugs.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.569
But if I time it right,

06:42.653 --> 06:45.989
three and a half ounces of booze right
before I go to bed helps with the dreams.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.202
Have you tried Nitrazepam or Prazosin?

06:50.285 --> 06:52.037
Have you ever killed someone
at long range?

06:55.624 --> 06:57.084
Pills affect my accuracy.

07:00.629 --> 07:05.050
Levi, you could have contested
the psych test and seen another doctor.

07:05.133 --> 07:05.968
Why didn't you?

07:06.468 --> 07:07.594
I had no reason to.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.054
You had no reason?

07:10.973 --> 07:13.642
There's not a lot of
reasons for me right now.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.983
What if I gave you a reason?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.298
Hey, Daddy.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.437
To music.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.856
To music.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.484
My Little Lion…

08:04.568 --> 08:05.652
How are you?

08:05.736 --> 08:06.570
You know.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.405
Better now I see you.

08:08.906 --> 08:13.452
There is a rumor
you were photographed in Belarus.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.413
A drone.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.123
Is that possible?

08:18.832 --> 08:24.171
Moscow cannot risk having a direct link
to the oligarch's death.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.511
He had four children.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.014
Give it to me.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.308
Give me your shame.

08:52.908 --> 08:58.455
The Belarusian made himself rich trading
in white phosphorus bombs and land mines.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.875
How many children's legs were lost?

09:02.459 --> 09:06.380
How many little faces were forever burnt
by those transactions?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.634
You give the shame to me…

09:17.099 --> 09:18.392
And you move forward.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.811
It's not so easy anymore.

09:22.855 --> 09:23.856
I don't sleep.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.483
Sometimes for days.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.987
Stay with me for a week or two.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.408
And we'll make a stew.
It would be good for both of us.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.325
I can't.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.329
Rabinovich has ordered me to a briefing
first thing tomorrow morning in Moscow.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.582
To hell with Rabinovich,
and to hell with Moscow.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.417
You're not Russian, you're Lithuanian.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.628
He says I'll be going dark
for at least a year.

09:47.796 --> 09:48.630
Perhaps more.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.092
Hey.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.095
Did you go to the doctor
I arranged for you?

09:55.179 --> 09:56.013
The specialist?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.098
- Yes, I did.
- And?

09:58.974 --> 10:00.601
There's nothing to be done.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.102
Look at me, I'm a wretch.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.813
Cancer eats me from the inside out.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.482
Liver, pancreas.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.485
Death will be a welcome change.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.487
And what if I'm not back?

10:12.988 --> 10:13.822
Hmm?

10:14.323 --> 10:17.910
You'll be alone,
and I won't even know when it happens.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.370
An easy solution.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.581
I've already decided.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.168
February 14th, Valentine's Day.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.211
What are you talking about?

10:27.836 --> 10:29.463
I'm going to do it myself.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.090
Assuming I'm not already dead, of course.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.175
Dad.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.180
- Dad, you're not--
- It's my life to take.

10:39.598 --> 10:43.060
I will be ready to finally rest here
next to your mother.

10:45.020 --> 10:49.983
So, wherever you are,
you light a candle for me,

10:50.067 --> 10:53.570
you look at the Hunter in the night sky,
then you'll know.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.785
Come on now, Little Lion.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.954
Let's have our beer,

11:02.829 --> 11:03.747
play a song,

11:05.082 --> 11:06.917
and say a proper goodbye.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.725
Place your left hand on the pad.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.482
Put your watch, your smart phone,
and your ID in the case.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.526
It just tells time.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.867
In three minutes,
we reach the edge of the no-fly zone.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.368
That's as far as we can take you.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.371
From the drop, you'll have
another 38 klicks north on foot.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.291
You're expected by 1600 hours tomorrow.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.709
Open it on the ground.

12:37.299 --> 12:38.717
Where are we?

12:39.801 --> 12:41.386
I'm not authorized to answer that.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.892
At long last, my sweet prince has come.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.896
Punctual even. Spot on time. What a guy.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.859
Jasper D. Drake, Royal Marines Commandos.
Just call me JD.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.987
Levi Kane, former US Marine, scout sniper.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.155
Mercenary?

14:23.238 --> 14:24.948
- Private contractor.
- Hmm.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.617
So, what did they tell you
about this mission?

14:26.700 --> 14:27.868
Not a damn thing.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.579
They gave me an unmarked topo map.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.997
I don't even know what country I'm in.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.666
I've been here an entire year
and I have no idea where I am.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.335
It's messed up, right?

14:36.835 --> 14:39.213
But that is just
the tippity-top of the iceberg.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.633
Man, am I glad to see you.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.967
Not a lot of contact, huh?

14:44.051 --> 14:47.012
You're the first person
I've spoken to face-to-face in a year.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.139
- You're all alone out here?
- Mm-hmm.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.017
And my tour rotation
officially ends at midnight.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.686
- So I'm the relief?
- Affirmative.

14:54.770 --> 14:57.064
Look, we'll get a drink
and I'll explain everything.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.316
There she is.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.527
West Tower Observation Post.

15:01.610 --> 15:04.321
Your home away from home
for the next 365 days.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.576
Completely self-sufficient, solar with
a generator backup, rain system,

15:09.660 --> 15:12.871
wild game is plentiful,
and there's a garden right there.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.581
Everything you need.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.583
What's that on the other side?

15:18.293 --> 15:19.837
That is East Tower.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.755
Contact with the other side
is strictly forbidden,

15:21.839 --> 15:25.092
which is irrelevant given the land mines
and lethal tactical barriers

15:25.175 --> 15:26.802
to the north and south of the Gorge.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.595
Can't get to the other side anyway.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.681
In practical terms,
East Tower is not an issue.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.724
They do their thing. You do yours.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.727
I did see movement over that side
earlier this morning.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.564
Think they just completed
their annual rotation too.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.983
Theoretically, the job's simple.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.484
You're not the principal line of defense.

15:42.568 --> 15:45.487
You're more like
a highly skilled maintenance man.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.447
Every day, you walk the western rim.

15:47.531 --> 15:50.450
There are automatic Phalanx gun turrets
every 600 meters or so.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.661
You restock the ammo in the auto gun,

15:52.744 --> 15:55.956
check the containment fence,
cloakers and suspended mines.

15:56.039 --> 16:00.002
There's an armory in the bunker outside.
Weapons, tools, replacement ammo, mines.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.086
Whatever you need.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.881
Radio check every 30 days.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.883
What's a cloaker?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.135
Cloaker is a type of
satellite transmitter.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.262
There's one every kilometer or so
along the rim,

16:10.345 --> 16:14.183
each with its own power
and backup power source.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.393
- What do they do?
- They cloak.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.354
They send a false signal
to all the satellites

16:19.438 --> 16:20.856
that pass overhead on a given day.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.443
They're designed to render the Gorge
invisible to spy satellites,

16:24.526 --> 16:26.278
but they also work with
shit like Google Earth.

16:27.362 --> 16:31.116
Ah. Um, there is no
outside communication here.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.910
No cell, no sat, no nothing.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.412
In case of an emergency,
there's a panic button

16:35.495 --> 16:38.582
on the dedicated shortwave radio
you use for monthly radio checks.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.542
Button triggers a signal,
which lets them know that--

16:40.626 --> 16:41.543
Let's who know?

16:42.211 --> 16:44.546
The powers that be, mate.

16:44.630 --> 16:45.464
Whoever.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.509
Did you spy the old air-raid sirens
atop the tower?

16:49.259 --> 16:53.388
If, somehow, all the cloakers fail at once
or if the Gorge is ever overrun,

16:53.472 --> 16:57.100
their automated system executes
something called a Straydog protocol.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.769
Straydog protocol.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.145
- What is that?
- No idea.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.899
But if you hear those air-raid sirens,
you run like hell.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.276
Copy that.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.861
Look, here's the deal.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.154
This place is old.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.324
I'm talking end of the Second World War,
early Cold War shit.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.784
And it's secret.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.536
Way back then, an agreement was made,

17:15.618 --> 17:17.788
and a coalition formed
to keep it a secret.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.915
So, now, every year, a new representative
from one of the western nations

17:20.999 --> 17:24.419
patrols the western rim and someone
on the other side patrols the eastern rim.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.503
They're your counterpart.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.632
You're telling me
leaders from the East and West

17:28.715 --> 17:31.009
have been secretly working together
for the last 75 years?

17:31.093 --> 17:35.472
No. I'm telling you there have been
nine Soviet Russian heads of state

17:35.556 --> 17:38.183
and 13 US presidents
since the coalitions were formed.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.435
And not one of them
has known about the Gorge.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.020
Give that a spin.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.403
Potato vodka. The still is in the armory.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.030
That's good.

17:53.532 --> 17:56.159
The recipe's been passed down for decades.
So please don't mess it up.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.914
Listen, I'm sorry, man. But I just
feel like I'm missing something.

18:00.998 --> 18:01.999
Hmm.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.794
So apart from keeping this place a secret,
what's the mission?

18:07.004 --> 18:08.672
I need to keep people
from going in the Gorge?

18:08.755 --> 18:09.590
No.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.552
You need to stop what's in the Gorge
from coming out.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.975
A year ago, I was in your boots and my
predecessor gave me the exact same speech.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.435
And what did I think of him?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.314
- That he's completely full of shit.
- Exactly.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.317
But trust me,
keep your eyes on the central Gorge walls.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.568
They're the most scalable.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.154
Sensor miniguns further north and south
should take care of the rest.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.739
Scale wh-- Take care of what?

18:43.582 --> 18:44.666
What the hell is that?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.377
That is what we call the Hollow Men.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.713
Nobody knows exactly what they are.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.340
I don't even know why they're called that.

18:52.424 --> 18:56.261
- It's the name of a T.S. Eliot poem.
- I don't know anything about that.

18:56.345 --> 18:59.389
All I know is that someone who had our job
called them that a long time ago

18:59.473 --> 19:00.474
and the name stuck.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.727
What I can tell you is in the late 1940s,

19:03.810 --> 19:06.188
they sent three entire battalions,

19:06.271 --> 19:09.149
2,400 men on horseback,
into the Gorge to clean it out.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.360
Not a single man returned.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.780
After that, they shifted to
a purely containment strategy.

19:16.365 --> 19:18.492
- How do you know all this?
- Same way you do.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.035
We're all briefed by our predecessor.

19:20.118 --> 19:23.372
- Okay, so this could be one--
- A decades-long game of telephone.

19:23.455 --> 19:24.289
Yeah.

19:27.751 --> 19:30.712
JD, what do you think's
really going on here?

19:31.296 --> 19:35.300
Well, the theory I think summarizes
the situation most succinctly

19:36.677 --> 19:41.682
is the Gorge is the door to hell
and we're standing guard at the gate.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.648
- Take care of yourself.
- Good luck, man.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.661
Man, am I happy to see you.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.787
Right on, brother!

22:08.871 --> 22:12.291
I need you to quickly confirm
your identity.

22:12.374 --> 22:15.794
Jasper D. Drake. Countersign: blue arrow.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.546
Thank you for your service.

22:28.557 --> 22:30.142
Rotation complete.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.310
Copy that.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.841
This is West Tower
performing radio check.

23:43.924 --> 23:44.925
Do you copy?

23:47.135 --> 23:49.429
I repeat, this is West Tower
performing radio check.

23:49.513 --> 23:50.973
Do you copy? Over.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.808
Authentication code?

23:53.809 --> 23:56.103
Alpha, Bravo, nine, seven, Omega.

23:56.979 --> 23:59.439
-  Enemy contact?
- Negative.

23:59.523 --> 24:00.774
Cloaker status?

24:01.275 --> 24:02.359
Green.

24:02.442 --> 24:03.777
Procedure is complete.

24:04.319 --> 24:05.863
30 days until next radio check.

24:06.363 --> 24:08.407
- Wait, I have a question that--
- Procedure is complete.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.971
Robert Frost.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.878
"If you're lonely when you're alone,
you're in bad company.

25:02.961 --> 25:03.962
Sartre.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.173
Jasper 'JD' Drake."

25:09.092 --> 25:13.597

27:35.322 --> 27:36.490

48:24.446 --> 48:26.615
What are you doing?

48:29.785 --> 48:30.869
Shit.

48:40.170 --> 48:41.547
Oh, my, my, my.

51:30.507 --> 51:31.592
Good evening, Drasa.

51:32.718 --> 51:34.761
Even though I'm not supposed to be here.

51:35.971 --> 51:37.055
Good evening, Levi.

51:37.639 --> 51:40.601
And we're cloaked, so who's watching?

51:44.605 --> 51:46.857
I-I made rabbit pie.

51:47.983 --> 51:49.151
Do you like rabbit pie?

51:50.777 --> 51:51.862
I intend to.

51:53.989 --> 51:54.990
What's that you're growing?

51:58.118 --> 51:59.244
I brought you flowers.

52:01.205 --> 52:02.289
'Course you did.

52:03.332 --> 52:04.374
Thank you.

52:10.297 --> 52:11.298
You're staring.

52:11.381 --> 52:13.634
Sorry. It's, uh…

52:14.218 --> 52:15.302
Yes?

52:18.430 --> 52:21.517
There's a lot more green in your eyes
than I was expecting.

52:25.646 --> 52:26.980
You smell.

52:28.273 --> 52:29.191
Terribly.

52:31.151 --> 52:32.152
I know.

52:32.236 --> 52:33.570
I underestimated the cable sag.

52:33.654 --> 52:35.364
I had to do the back half by hand.

52:35.447 --> 52:38.534
Yeah. I don't think I can allow you
to come in smelling this way.

52:38.617 --> 52:41.411
Why don't you go, uh,
wash up quick at the bathhouse?

52:41.954 --> 52:44.581
I'll set out some fresh clothes
from my predecessors outside the door.

53:47.853 --> 53:53.108
Yukon? Siberia? Remote Scandinavia, maybe?

53:53.192 --> 53:54.818
I don't know.
They sedated me on the flight.

53:54.902 --> 53:57.154
- I'm not sure how long I was out.
- Same.

53:57.863 --> 53:59.865
It's somewhere
in the far northern hemisphere though.

53:59.948 --> 54:00.949
I know that much.

54:01.033 --> 54:02.409
How can you be so sure about that?

54:02.492 --> 54:03.869
The seasons.

54:04.578 --> 54:06.163
It was early fall when I left the States.

54:06.246 --> 54:07.331
It was still fall when I arrived.

54:08.290 --> 54:09.291
Military?

54:10.667 --> 54:11.668
Marines.

54:11.752 --> 54:12.628
Former.

54:12.711 --> 54:14.880
What's the longest kill shot
you've ever made?

54:14.963 --> 54:17.299
Don't say that you don't know.

54:17.382 --> 54:19.510
Every top-shelf sniper
knows the distance of every ticket

54:19.593 --> 54:21.303
they've ever punched, so come on.

54:21.386 --> 54:22.763
3,241 meters.

54:22.846 --> 54:23.972
Thirty-two hun--

54:24.640 --> 54:25.474
A kill shot?

54:26.558 --> 54:27.809
Yeah.

54:29.895 --> 54:31.647
That would put you in, uh--

54:31.730 --> 54:32.814
Top five in the world.

54:33.982 --> 54:36.902
Did you make that impossible shot
in Yemen, May of last year?

54:39.696 --> 54:41.073
I did not participate in,

54:41.156 --> 54:42.407
nor do I have any knowledge…

54:42.491 --> 54:44.201
…of any operation
in Yemen in May of last year.

54:44.284 --> 54:48.247
Rumor was it was windy,
25 knots east to west, with gusts of 40.

54:48.330 --> 54:51.083
That would have been
a very, very good shot.

54:51.166 --> 54:53.001
3,800 meters.

54:53.085 --> 54:53.919
World record.

54:54.503 --> 54:56.421
I'd kiss the ring
of whoever made that shot.

54:57.714 --> 54:58.882
Too bad it wasn't you.

55:02.845 --> 55:03.720
What?

55:07.349 --> 55:10.269
I've been staring at this gorge every day
for the last six months.

55:10.352 --> 55:14.982
And I gotta say,
the view is much better over here.

55:18.777 --> 55:20.696
You know what I keep thinking about,
night after night,

55:20.779 --> 55:22.489
while I sit over there on that platform?

55:22.573 --> 55:23.657
How you're gonna get in my pants?

55:30.414 --> 55:31.665
Well, after that.

55:31.748 --> 55:33.292
Yes, after that, sorry.

55:33.375 --> 55:35.586
Please, tell me.
What have you been thinking about?

55:37.713 --> 55:39.298
What's the truth about this place?

55:40.257 --> 55:42.801
What's the truth about those Hollow Men
down in the Gorge?

55:44.094 --> 55:45.220
You know,

55:46.680 --> 55:49.224
a long time ago, before I was born,

55:50.475 --> 55:51.685
my father was KGB.

55:52.311 --> 55:56.690
And years later, when I was a child,
he would say to me, uh…

55:57.983 --> 56:01.653
…"Drasa, my Little Lion,
you don't want to know the truth.

56:02.613 --> 56:03.989
It's better if you don't know."

56:04.072 --> 56:06.366
And I would bitch and whine,
and say, "Why, Daddy?

56:07.075 --> 56:08.619
Why don't I want to know the truth?"

56:11.205 --> 56:12.039
What did he say?

56:12.998 --> 56:14.249
He would say,

56:14.958 --> 56:17.961
"Because too much truth
puts sadness in your heart

56:18.045 --> 56:20.005
and madness in your mind."

56:20.923 --> 56:21.924
I don't know.

56:23.467 --> 56:25.802
In my experience,
it's hiding the truth that does that.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.013
And when did you learn that?

56:30.766 --> 56:32.142
First time I pulled the trigger.

56:34.019 --> 56:35.062
Will you tell me about it?

56:39.399 --> 56:40.567
It was just outside of Belize,

56:40.651 --> 56:43.153
and I was on a fishing boat
two klicks away.

56:45.322 --> 56:48.784
I've had the same recurring
nightmare about it ever since.

56:50.369 --> 56:51.370
Who have you told this to?

56:53.455 --> 56:54.289
Just you.

56:56.500 --> 56:58.210
Why did you choose this profession?

57:00.838 --> 57:01.964
Um…

57:03.757 --> 57:06.635
Hunting was just a part of
my homeschooling growing up in Oregon,

57:07.261 --> 57:11.682
and my dad,
he was the best instructor I ever had.

57:13.141 --> 57:13.976
He loved it.

57:15.227 --> 57:16.311
He made me love it.

57:16.812 --> 57:17.938
Love what exactly?

57:19.314 --> 57:20.941
The art of the perfect shot.

57:24.611 --> 57:25.445
Yeah.

57:25.946 --> 57:26.947
Do you still love it?

57:27.447 --> 57:28.615
Not like I did.

57:30.450 --> 57:35.372
I can't compartmentalize
the way I used to.

57:36.748 --> 57:37.875
Oh.

57:37.958 --> 57:39.710
My father always heard my secrets.

57:40.836 --> 57:42.212
I didn't have to bury them.

57:46.383 --> 57:51.805
You bury enough secrets,
the graveyard runs out of room.

57:58.520 --> 58:01.190
You dragged your mattress up the stairs
and made your bed here.

58:02.399 --> 58:03.650
For tactical reasons.

58:04.401 --> 58:05.569
I did the same thing.

01:00:03.729 --> 01:00:05.063
Did you lie to me, Levi?

01:00:05.981 --> 01:00:07.191
About what?

01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:10.152
Being a terrible dancer.

01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:13.822
Maybe a little bit.

01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:11.088
There.

01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:13.882
Those three close together.

01:01:15.217 --> 01:01:16.593
Orion's Belt.

01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:18.428
I see it.

01:01:19.388 --> 01:01:22.266
He told me to look at the Hunter
on Valentine's Day

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.560
knowing that he had ended it.

01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:26.270
I'm sorry.

01:01:30.816 --> 01:01:34.278
What do you do
when the sadness overwhelms you?

01:01:36.822 --> 01:01:39.575
Sometimes I'll read a poem.

01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:44.121
Maybe try and write one.

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:46.373
You write poetry?

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:49.293
Almost every day.

01:01:50.711 --> 01:01:52.004
Seriously?

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.882
I even took a class.

01:01:55.757 --> 01:01:59.344
Wednesday nights, 4:00 to 7:00 p.m.,
at Mesa Community College.

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:03.515
Well, um, are you talented?

01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:05.517
No, I'm terrible.

01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:07.686
Oh, sure. Like you're a terrible dancer?

01:02:08.187 --> 01:02:09.479
Yeah.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.899
Will you write me a terrible poem?

01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:14.109
Maybe I already have.

01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:16.695
Recite it for me.

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:19.698
- Absolutely not.
- Oh, come on.

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:21.366
No chance in hell.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:23.827
- At least tell me the title?
- No.

01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:25.621
Well, then I don't believe you.

01:02:25.704 --> 01:02:27.831
You haven't written
a terrible poem for me, have you?

01:02:27.915 --> 01:02:29.208
I have.

01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:30.626
But I just started it.

01:02:30.709 --> 01:02:32.461
Then tell me the title.

01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:37.049
- It's a working title.
- Tell me the working title.

01:02:40.427 --> 01:02:42.221
"She Collapsed the Night."

01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:50.229
It's that bad?

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:51.980
I love it.

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.608
Shit.

01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:55.859
I love it.

01:02:56.485 --> 01:02:58.195
No, you have to tell me.

01:02:58.278 --> 01:03:00.072
- Come on. Please. Please.
- There's no--

01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:01.657
That's not happening.

01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:06.787
Did you like the rabbit pie?

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:07.871
No.

01:03:09.206 --> 01:03:11.041
I fucking loved the rabbit pie.

01:03:32.855 --> 01:03:33.981
No!

01:03:36.775 --> 01:03:37.901
Levi!

01:06:31.825 --> 01:06:34.077
Don't touch it.
It's some kind of adhesive.

01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:35.162
Okay.

01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:38.081
You came for me.

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:40.918
Like you wouldn't do the same.

01:06:44.463 --> 01:06:46.590
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:49.259
Please tell me
you brought an auto ascender.

01:06:49.343 --> 01:06:50.469
Of course I did.

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:53.263
Let's head to the east wall
and find the cable.

01:07:20.249 --> 01:07:21.625
Drasa.

01:08:12.676 --> 01:08:14.011
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:08:15.095 --> 01:08:16.555
What do you think they wanted?

01:08:17.264 --> 01:08:21.435
Given how emaciated they are,
my guess is that to them we're food.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.770
One of them rode off.

01:08:23.854 --> 01:08:25.314
Yeah, I saw that.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:31.278
No.

01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:32.946
- What?
- The auto ascender.

01:08:34.531 --> 01:08:39.077
Must have fallen out in the river,
and it's 500 meters to the top.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.290
We're stuck here.

01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:50.671
We follow the river south.

01:08:51.423 --> 01:08:53.300
Has to drain out of the Gorge somewhere.

01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:56.845
It's a military uniform.

01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:02.309
Old military. First Airborne American.

01:09:02.392 --> 01:09:05.687
I saw British SAS
and a Soviet Spetsnaz back there.

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:06.897
Postwar.

01:09:10.192 --> 01:09:12.694
All these uniforms are from the 1940s.

01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:17.115
Cavalry on horseback.

01:09:17.783 --> 01:09:19.660
They're the lost battalions.

01:09:20.953 --> 01:09:23.037
They should be long dead, Levi.

01:09:25.207 --> 01:09:26.500
We should keep moving.

01:10:07.165 --> 01:10:09.459
"This is the way the world ends.

01:10:09.543 --> 01:10:12.004
Not with a bang but a whimper."

01:10:13.172 --> 01:10:17.759
It's from the T.S. Eliot poem about people
stuck in a world between life and death.

01:10:18.677 --> 01:10:20.512
It's called "The Hollow Men."

01:10:20.596 --> 01:10:22.097
The Hollow Men.

01:10:24.016 --> 01:10:25.058
Yeah.

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:18.904
This damage looks seismic.

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:20.989
Earthquake maybe.

01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:11.934
Cyanide.

01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:14.645
They chose to do it themselves.

01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:18.607
What's worse than death?

01:13:19.358 --> 01:13:20.776
This place is evil.

01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:33.075
Making a hole!

01:15:49.633 --> 01:15:53.011
Shit. They're everywhere.
We're too exposed.

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:55.264
The Gorge wall.

01:16:00.477 --> 01:16:01.645
Levi.

01:16:01.728 --> 01:16:03.188
We get boxed in, we're screwed.

01:16:03.272 --> 01:16:05.649
We're screwed anyway.

01:16:09.987 --> 01:16:11.029
Barricade.

01:18:35.257 --> 01:18:36.258
Levi.

01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:44.725
It's a backup generator.

01:18:44.808 --> 01:18:47.227
Propane remains stable indefinitely, so…

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:23.305
It is July 12th or 13th, 1946.

01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:25.891
Our community here was formed

01:19:25.974 --> 01:19:28.810
as part of a top secret coalition
of nations from both East and West.

01:19:29.686 --> 01:19:31.396
During the last years of World War II,

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.649
while Robert Oppenheimer
and his Los Alamos community

01:19:33.732 --> 01:19:34.816
developed the atom bomb,

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.445
we were developing similarly
destructive biochemical missiles.

01:19:39.196 --> 01:19:43.075
Six days ago,
an 8.1 earthquake struck this location,

01:19:43.158 --> 01:19:46.203
severely compromising
the integrity of our facility.

01:19:46.286 --> 01:19:51.124
Our duty here is no longer about research,
but containment.

01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:57.172
We are working around the clock

01:19:57.256 --> 01:19:59.883
to ensure this toxin
doesn't escape the Gorge.

01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:03.470
Exposure to the biochemical contaminant

01:20:03.554 --> 01:20:08.058
has literally merged the genetic DNA
of the biological entities

01:20:08.141 --> 01:20:09.393
in our gorge environment.

01:20:09.977 --> 01:20:15.774
Human DNA has merged with plants,
animals and even insects.

01:20:17.651 --> 01:20:20.863
Some people are more resistant
to contamination than others,

01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:24.283
especially if exposure is limited
to hours instead of days.

01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:29.413
If infected, mutations will begin
to appear within five days.

01:20:29.913 --> 01:20:33.125
They will present themselves physically,
like this.

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:40.174
Our strategic forethought
in choosing this isolated location

01:20:40.257 --> 01:20:43.719
is the only factor that may possibly save
the rest of humankind

01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:45.971
from the fate
that we have sealed for ourselves.

01:20:47.514 --> 01:20:48.765
I'm so sorry.

01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:51.602
May God have mercy on our souls.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.739
Sounds like we could be fine
if our exposure is limited to hours.

01:21:03.822 --> 01:21:06.325
Well, let's find a way out quick then.

01:21:07.534 --> 01:21:08.410
What?

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.954
Maybe a way out.

01:21:19.588 --> 01:21:21.507
That's not from the 1940s.

01:21:22.174 --> 01:21:23.217
Late 2000s.

01:21:24.718 --> 01:21:26.678
Why not just send in a bomber squadron?

01:21:26.762 --> 01:21:28.764
Erase this whole mess and call it a day.

01:21:30.891 --> 01:21:33.143
"Darklake." Paramilitary.

01:21:34.102 --> 01:21:35.270
They haven't bombed the Gorge

01:21:35.354 --> 01:21:37.189
because they're still studying
what's in it.

01:21:38.899 --> 01:21:40.776
We're not working for the military.

01:21:45.322 --> 01:21:47.491
They used all this
to set up their research drones.

01:21:48.784 --> 01:21:52.621
Darklake is a huge corporation
specializing in genetic research.

01:21:54.706 --> 01:21:57.501
Their drones are collecting
hybrid DNA samples.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:00.128
They're building super soldiers.

01:22:01.046 --> 01:22:02.840
That's the mother of all secrets.

01:22:03.507 --> 01:22:06.176
Young soldiers and scientists
studied like suffering lab rats.

01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.679
Private defense contractors
have been researching

01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:11.265
genetic soldier enhancement for decades,

01:22:12.015 --> 01:22:14.059
and everything down here
is genetically brand-new.

01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:17.479
We're here to protect their secrets.

01:23:01.481 --> 01:23:04.067
Before we head out,
I need to say something to you.

01:23:04.693 --> 01:23:06.069
Let me guess.

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:07.196
It's your poem?

01:23:07.279 --> 01:23:10.073
No, it's not my poem.

01:23:13.202 --> 01:23:16.955
If something happens,
and we don't make it out of here,

01:23:17.039 --> 01:23:19.833
and this is the way the world ends,
for us anyway,

01:23:21.418 --> 01:23:22.878
to me it was worth it

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.589
because I got to know you.

01:23:26.507 --> 01:23:27.883
It wasn't easy,

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:30.511
getting to know each other.

01:23:31.011 --> 01:23:32.012
No, it wasn't.

01:23:37.518 --> 01:23:41.313
Mmm.

01:23:43.023 --> 01:23:44.274
You ready for this?

01:23:46.777 --> 01:23:48.237
We go strong.

01:23:55.953 --> 01:23:59.248
My gear pack.
I left it here. It has all the ammo in it.

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:08.090
These things can think tactically.

01:24:23.397 --> 01:24:24.982
They're playing with us.

01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:27.526
They know we can't see a thing.

01:24:31.405 --> 01:24:32.948
Let's make it mutual.

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:27.628
Drasa!

01:26:45.706 --> 01:26:48.208
Drasa!

01:27:32.669 --> 01:27:37.299
I'm going to cut
what's left of your ugly face off.

01:29:22.362 --> 01:29:24.156
Are you okay?

01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:27.534
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Yeah.

01:29:33.665 --> 01:29:35.292
"B. Shaw."

01:29:36.585 --> 01:29:37.669
Bradford.

01:29:40.756 --> 01:29:43.050
He was the first soldier
in the West Tower.

01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:46.345
He named the Hollow Men.

01:29:51.475 --> 01:29:52.309
Levi.

01:29:57.231 --> 01:29:58.315
Where are we?

01:30:07.449 --> 01:30:09.618
We're in a chemical missile facility.

01:30:09.701 --> 01:30:11.620
I came down a missile silo.

01:30:11.703 --> 01:30:13.247
They're the only way out.

01:30:25.926 --> 01:30:29.179
The earthquake damaged the missiles,
and they started leaking.

01:30:32.057 --> 01:30:34.309
The contaminant is in the fog.

01:33:46.293 --> 01:33:47.878
I know how we're getting out of here.

01:33:48.378 --> 01:33:50.506
These old jeeps have powerful winches.

01:33:50.589 --> 01:33:52.508
It'll work just like an auto ascender.

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:31.964
Head to the eastern wall.

01:34:32.047 --> 01:34:33.549
The zip line should be close.

01:34:36.593 --> 01:34:38.262
There. That's it.

01:35:03.996 --> 01:35:05.289
I'm out.

01:36:01.803 --> 01:36:03.180
Levi.

01:36:10.979 --> 01:36:11.980
Levi!

01:36:22.741 --> 01:36:23.659
Toolbox.

01:37:22.718 --> 01:37:23.844
No!

01:37:28.515 --> 01:37:29.349
The propane!

01:38:12.518 --> 01:38:13.852
Cut the rope.

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.771
Levi.

01:38:45.217 --> 01:38:46.760
It was so surreal down there.

01:38:48.929 --> 01:38:50.931
Like a waking nightmare.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.894
That's as close to hell
as I ever want to get.

01:38:58.272 --> 01:39:00.065
We'll need to quarantine.

01:39:00.148 --> 01:39:03.443
Five days.

01:39:08.365 --> 01:39:09.783
What if we're infected?

01:39:12.578 --> 01:39:14.371
I'll do what's necessary.

01:39:19.835 --> 01:39:20.878
Same.

01:39:22.504 --> 01:39:24.339
I have radio check tomorrow.

01:39:25.132 --> 01:39:26.091
Same.

01:39:26.967 --> 01:39:29.553
I don't know how
I'm supposed to get back across.

01:39:30.053 --> 01:39:32.389
There's a C19 grappling gun in the back.

01:39:33.974 --> 01:39:35.184
That should do it.

01:39:36.059 --> 01:39:38.770
Well, I guess
the Russians stock a better armory.

01:39:38.854 --> 01:39:41.815
They also make better vodka.

01:39:42.733 --> 01:39:43.734
Here.

01:39:45.152 --> 01:39:47.237
To making it out alive.

01:39:56.079 --> 01:39:58.248
Do you know why I even got this job?

01:39:58.790 --> 01:40:01.043
Because of that impossible shot
you made in Yemen?

01:40:01.126 --> 01:40:04.546
No, I wasn't lying about that.

01:40:05.297 --> 01:40:06.632
I didn't make that shot.

01:40:06.715 --> 01:40:07.841
I know.

01:40:08.342 --> 01:40:10.260
I know exactly who made that shot.

01:40:13.347 --> 01:40:14.598
Why did you get the job?

01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:19.436
They chose me because I was expendable.

01:40:20.312 --> 01:40:21.563
Expendable?

01:40:22.523 --> 01:40:23.774
No attachments.

01:40:24.274 --> 01:40:26.944
No one to miss me if I disappeared.

01:40:29.029 --> 01:40:31.365
Nothing to live for
except the next mission.

01:40:34.576 --> 01:40:36.328
But now it's all flipped.

01:40:38.205 --> 01:40:40.290
And I have everything to live for.

01:40:45.254 --> 01:40:46.380
We could run.

01:40:47.047 --> 01:40:50.467
I know a place in France,
and we could be safe there.

01:40:50.968 --> 01:40:52.427
For as long as we want.

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:58.600
Drasa, I want to leave with you
more than anything in the world.

01:40:58.684 --> 01:41:00.644
But what about this place?

01:41:00.727 --> 01:41:03.272
What about the next pair of soldiers
that they bring in here,

01:41:03.355 --> 01:41:06.817
and inherit their secrets, and their lies?

01:41:09.319 --> 01:41:11.697
And every Hollow Man is a contaminant.

01:41:12.406 --> 01:41:13.866
So if one of them gets out…

01:41:18.412 --> 01:41:20.247
We need to destroy the Gorge.

01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:31.758
Remember,
mutations will appear within five days.

01:41:31.842 --> 01:41:35.095
So, if we make it to day six,
we're in the clear.

01:41:35.179 --> 01:41:37.181
- But if not--
- If not, we're dead.

01:41:37.264 --> 01:41:40.058
But if we're clear, we meet up next week.

01:41:42.019 --> 01:41:43.020
We go strong.

01:41:43.604 --> 01:41:45.606
- Yes?
- Always.

01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:51.069
- Lis--
- Don't say good-bye.

01:41:52.571 --> 01:41:54.114
I don't want to hear you say that.

01:41:54.198 --> 01:41:55.657
I wasn't going to say good-bye.

01:41:55.741 --> 01:41:58.702
Okay. And what were you gonna say?

01:42:07.586 --> 01:42:08.879
That I love you.

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:18.013
This is West Tower performing radio check.
Do you copy?

01:42:19.473 --> 01:42:21.475
I repeat, this is West Tower
performing radio check.

01:42:21.558 --> 01:42:23.393
Do you copy? Over.

01:42:23.477 --> 01:42:24.853
Authentication code?

01:42:25.812 --> 01:42:27.981
Delta, Theta, four, one, Omega.

01:42:28.065 --> 01:42:29.191
Stand by.

01:42:30.943 --> 01:42:34.363
Levi? Do you know who this is?

01:42:36.657 --> 01:42:37.991
Yes.

01:42:38.075 --> 01:42:41.370
Our research drone computer system
was activated.

01:42:42.412 --> 01:42:44.248
Did you go into the Gorge?

01:42:44.998 --> 01:42:48.794
Negative. But I did see
one of your drones fly out of here.

01:42:49.336 --> 01:42:51.672
Seems like you're not a spook after all.

01:42:52.965 --> 01:42:54.466
The private sector is where

01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:58.095
the most important scientific progress
happens these days.

01:42:58.679 --> 01:43:01.348
Do you know what kind of work I do here?

01:43:01.431 --> 01:43:03.350
I'm assuming the kind that pays well.

01:43:03.934 --> 01:43:06.562
Let's just say the primary aim
of our research

01:43:06.645 --> 01:43:09.523
is to make American ground forces
unbeatable

01:43:09.606 --> 01:43:12.568
against any foreign army in the world.

01:43:12.651 --> 01:43:16.113
I'm sure you can appreciate what
we could do with a military like that.

01:43:17.906 --> 01:43:19.116
Absolutely.

01:43:21.577 --> 01:43:27.541
Levi, have you noticed any movement
from your eastern counterpart?

01:43:31.670 --> 01:43:32.671
Negative.

01:43:33.297 --> 01:43:37.426
Because if it wasn't you that activated
our computer system in the Gorge,

01:43:38.010 --> 01:43:40.637
I have to assume
that it was your eastern counterpart.

01:43:42.347 --> 01:43:45.601
There are, after all,
only the two of you there.

01:43:48.228 --> 01:43:50.772
You are to neutralize your counterpart.

01:43:52.733 --> 01:43:54.151
Immediately.

01:43:55.152 --> 01:43:56.612
Do you understand?

01:43:58.363 --> 01:43:59.907
Consider it done.

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:03.243
Copy that. Thank you, Levi.

01:44:23.722 --> 01:44:27.809
Commander, Levi Kane is compromised.

01:44:27.893 --> 01:44:30.229
Gather your team.
We'll leave in the morning.

01:44:30.312 --> 01:44:32.147
You're coming with us, ma'am?

01:44:32.231 --> 01:44:33.732
He's my mistake.

01:44:34.608 --> 01:44:37.027
I'll kill him myself if I have to.

01:46:00.235 --> 01:46:01.486
Run!

01:46:34.686 --> 01:46:37.105
There's no sign of Levi Kane
anywhere in the tower

01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:39.149
or on the surrounding compound.

01:46:39.233 --> 01:46:40.859
What if he decided to run?

01:46:43.737 --> 01:46:45.197
Raise the quadcopters.

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.407
There's no sign of the counterpart either.

01:46:47.491 --> 01:46:50.452
If Levi didn't keep his post,
why believe that he would have killed her?

01:46:52.454 --> 01:46:53.622
Split them up.

01:46:54.122 --> 01:46:56.667
Drone protocol, quadcopters, verification…

01:49:25.816 --> 01:49:27.734
Commander, what's that on the wall?

01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:59.433
"Three things cannot be long hidden:

01:50:00.225 --> 01:50:04.771
the sun, the moon and the truth.

01:50:06.273 --> 01:50:07.191
Buddha.

01:50:09.568 --> 01:50:11.028
Levi Kane."

01:50:45.354 --> 01:50:46.772
What the hell was that?

01:51:08.585 --> 01:51:12.381
The cloakers. He's rigged the cloakers.

01:51:15.759 --> 01:51:17.135
The Gorge is exposed.

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.980
Straydog.

01:51:30.107 --> 01:51:31.483
We have two minutes.

01:51:37.281 --> 01:51:39.408
Prepare for immediate takeoff.

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.884
Get us airborne. Now!

01:52:17.821 --> 01:52:20.949
Forget altitude! We need distance!

01:52:43.555 --> 01:52:45.057
Fast!

01:56:53.305 --> 01:56:54.681
Hello, Drasa.

01:56:54.765 --> 01:56:57.768
Hello, Levi. You're late.

01:56:58.727 --> 01:57:01.855
Sorry. I, uh, got injured at my old job.

01:57:01.939 --> 01:57:05.317
Well, if you're looking for a new one,
the kitchen's hiring.

01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.735
Got any special skills?

01:57:08.237 --> 01:57:09.488
I'm a pretty good shot.

01:57:09.571 --> 01:57:10.864
How good?

01:57:10.948 --> 01:57:12.824
Last one was 3,900 meters.

01:57:13.617 --> 01:57:15.410
Had to beat my record.

01:57:17.037 --> 01:57:18.497
I had to get back to you.
